Conclusions and next steps 
-Create a Kaggle dataset
-Create some kind of API that will use this data to give training advices
-Maybe add regional and games data 

-Is there a competitive benefit to focusing on cardio or weightlifting, both of which feature in the Crossfit Program? 
-What is the impact of BMI on different types of activities? 
-What is the impact of age or gender 

Older Athletes: Based on survey responses, older athlets (35+) were more careful with their diets and were even less likely to perform well with a higher BMI Index. The lesson here is that while BMI is critical in all age groups, it getes more important with age to stay relatively lean. 

-Wish I had more data on the number of workouts per week 

Since these data were pre-existing and publicly available, the University's Institutional Review Board classified this study as exempt, which did not require athletes to provide their informed consent.
