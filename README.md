OVERALL QUESTION TRYING TO HIT: 



OBJECTIVES: 

- Stats for Athletes participation   
   - Age, height, weight (distribution and numbers)
   - Where did these athletes come from (heatmap)? 
   - Maybe a pin of all the crossfit gyms that participated in the US
- Does BMI matter more as we age? 
- Between what years of doing CrossFit do we see the highest growth increase in Open Score and is there a statistical difference? -> Adjust for the number of athletes that participated each year (%)
- The performance of different prediction models with CF test data and open benchmark stats 
   -Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression 
   -Feature Importance (Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost)

- Does consistency across the three events improve results? 

1. GET THE STATES FOR EVERY CATEGORY 
#PROFILES MALE AND FEMALE

   a. Age: count gender, mean age, std., min age, 25% age, 50% age 75% age, max age 
   -Overlay age of male and female onto each other

   b. Height: Count gender, mean height, std. height, min height. 25% height, 50% height, 75% height, max height 
   -Overlay of height male and female onto each other

   c. Weight: count gender, mean weight, std., min weight, 25% weight, 50% weight, 75% weigth, max weight 
   -Overlay of weight male and female to each other

   d. Number of athletes and where they came from (Heatmap of the world) 


* SEE LEBLANC EXAMPLE AND SAM EXAMPLE*

3. Score variability vs. overall finish 

4. Score in Younger Athletes as BMI goes up vs. Older Athletes: Based on survey responses, older athlets (35+) were more careful with their diets and were even less likely to perform well with a higher BMI Index. The lesson here is that while BMI is critical in all age groups, it getes more important with age to stay relatively lean. 

4. The performance of different prediction models for CF test data w/ benchmark stats.
   a. Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression 
      i. The performance in the Open 
      ii. Weightlifting Categories 

   b. Feature Importances w/ Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Mean 
      i. The performance in the open 
      ii. Deadlift 
      iii. 5k run
   
   c. Is there a competitive benefit to focusing on cardio or weightlifting, both of which feature in the Crossfit Program? 

Weightlifting
Back Squat
Clean and Jerk
Snatch
Deadlift

Benchmark Workouts
Fight Gone Bad
Fran
Grace
Helen
Filthy 50

Running Exercices
Sprint 400m
Run 5k

Sam Swift Take that and post on Medium

24.1
Dumbbel Snatches and Burpees

24.2
Row
Deadlift
Double-Under 

24.3
Thruster 
C2B 
Muscle Up 

Conclusions and next steps 
-Create a Kaggle dataset
-Create some kind of API that will use this data to give training advices
-Maybe add regional and games data 


-What is the impact of BMI on different types of activities? 
-What is the impact of age or gender 


-Wish I had more data on the number of workouts per week 

Since these data were pre-existing and publicly available, the University's Institutional Review Board classified this study as exempt, which did not require athletes to provide their informed consent. 

H2F 
-Fitness Tests 
   -50 tests total you can input your scores on 
-Daily Workout Program 
-Austere Conditions Program 
-Postpartum Workout Program 
-Leaderboard 
-Highest in one category is 1,294 entries and then 152 entries
